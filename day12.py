#find e find s

#find distance to e

#start at s 

#step through only when the alphabet you started at is lower than you

#keep track of the shortest path by calculating eucledian distance and also keeping track of the steps it takes to get there because eucledian is not steps?

#at convergence it can equal going from botttom to top and or left to right and they're equal then it's fine to just state the steps for one of them.
